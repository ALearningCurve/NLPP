pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```
The list is here if you want to use another method as well as with descriptions of how we used them in our project:

  	Django                  (The backend framework for site)
  	pillow                  (Helps with images)
	bcrypt                  (Better hashing)
	django[argon2]		(Better hashing)
	django-braces           (Better Template Tagging)
	django-bootstrap4       (Better Styling of Built in Django Forms
 	misaka                  (Allows for easier HTML storage in the database [such as markdown to html])
	django-debug-toolbar    (Easier to debug)
	djangorestframework	(Allows for us to make a custom api)
	requests		(Allows to send an http request from python app [used for APIs])
	django-clear-cache	(Quickly clears the session without needing settings.py path to be set]
	django-bleach 		(Escape HTML, regulate parameters, regulate styles, regulate protocols, etc.) 
	nltk			(PDF Extraction -- need to get nltk.corpus and nltk.tokenize with "nltk.download("name"))
	PyPDF2			(PDF Extraction)
	textract		(PDF Extraction)
	pytesseract		(Image Extraction)
	
 # Quickstart
 To run the server, navigate into the same level as manage.py and type in the commandline python manage.py runserver
 To acess the ip:port/admin page to view the databases, create a super user with the python manage.py createsuperuser command
 After adding a model, first do python manage.py makemigrations and then python manage.py migrate
 
# Accessing the Website
The website can found using [bit.ly/brom-nlpp](https://bit.ly/brom-nlpp)

The website itself can be updated using a shared bash, email me for the link.
To update the site if there is a new version of github go the ~/NLPP/NLPP (but not ~/NLPP/NLPP/NLPP) and then
1. `git pull`
	* If there is a merge conflict, then use `git reset --hard`, but be aware that this will overide all files on the site, so don't do this in production
	* To save the changes that are on the server, such as for the database use the following commands
		1. git stash
		2. git pull
		3. git stash pop
		4. git checkout --theirs NLPP/db.sqlite3      <â€” if there is a merge error
		5. git merge

2. `touch /var/www/alearningcurve_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py`     
	* this command will restart the webserver so your changes appear, but it will take a few seconds, so be patient!
	
3. If the website is unavailible, the site's free trail may of expired and will need to be restarted by me (William Walling-Sotolongo)
